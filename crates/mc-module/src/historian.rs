//! Historian writer orchestration: the durable firing state machine
//! (idle → firing → awaiting_producer → validating → publishing), the pinned
//! ordinal-range chunk snapshot with fail-loud fingerprint verification, and the
//! CAS-gated publish transaction whose writes surface only through the m1
//! watermark on the next materializing pass (a publish never busts the cache).
//!
//! Stub: implementation lands with the writer-relocation W1/W3 units.
